# Ako HTTP Framework

This project is heavly inspired from NextJS file based router. It only SSR. 
This project is just a hobby project and it didn't written for production useage.

Currently it is not finished. 30 May 2025

I tried to use mostly DI (not like Facades in Laravel). Some of the shared utilites are shared with a Context class. Still not sure it was a good idea or not. 


## File Structure (Development Stage)
- framework/ : You can find most of the files related to the framework. 
- src/ : It is for usage of the framework.


## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement route finder by files. 
- [ ] Fix phpdoc mostly there are not many. 
- [ ] Make a CLI for ease of usage.
- [ ] Middlewares.
