# Ako HTTP Framework

This project is heavly inspired from NextJS file based router. It only SSR. 
This project is just a hobby project and it didn't written for production useage.

Currently most of the things are didn't implemented.

I tried to use mostly DI (not like Facades in Laravel). Some of the shared utilites are shared with a Context class. Still not sure it was a good idea or not. 


## File Structure (Development Stage)
- framework/ : You can find most of the files related to the framework. 
- src/ : It is for usage of the framework.
